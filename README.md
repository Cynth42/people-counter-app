## What it Does

The people counter application will demonstrate how to create a smart video IoT solution using Intel® hardware and software tools. The app will detect people in a designated area, providing the number of people in the frame, average duration of people in frame, and total count.

## How it Works

The counter will use the Inference Engine included in the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ Toolkit. The model used should be able to identify people in a video frame. The app should count the number of people in the current frame, the duration that a person is in the frame (time elapsed between entering and exiting a frame) and the total count of people. It then sends the data to a local web server using the Paho MQTT Python package.

* You will choose a model to use and convert it with the Model Optimizer.

One of the models(SSD MobileNet V2 COCO)from the Object Detection Models zoo that are supported was used in this application.  You can find the link here:

   ```

* For Web server:
  ```
  cd ../ui
  npm install
  ```
  **Note:** If any configuration errors occur in mosca server or Web server while using **npm install**, use the below commands:
   ```
   sudo npm install npm -g 
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm cache clean
   npm config set registry "http://registry.npmjs.org"
   npm install
   ```

## Configure the application

### What model to use

This application uses the SSD MobileNet V2 COCO from the Object Detection Models zoo that are supported.

* To download model, get the link address:  
```
wget http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/ssd_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28.tar.gz
```

* Use the tar command with the downloaded file to extract it:
```
tar -xvf ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_03_29.tar.gz
```

* Then cd into the file and run the convert the model with all parameters command:
```
python /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/model_optimizer/mo.py --input_model frozen_inference_graph.pb --tensorflow_object_detection_api_pipeline_config pipeline.config --reverse_input_channels --tensorflow_use_custom_operations_config /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/model_optimizer/extensions/front/tf/ssd_v2_support.json  
```

### Run the Application
Go to people-counter-python directory:
```
cd <path_to_people-counter-python_directory>
```  

### Step 1 - Start the Mosca server

```
cd webservice/server/node-server
node ./server.js
```

You should see the following message, if successful:
```
Mosca server started.
```

### Step 2 - Start the GUI

Open new terminal and run below commands.
```
cd webservice/ui
npm run dev
```

You should see the following message in the terminal.
```
webpack: Compiled successfully
```

### Step 3 - FFmpeg Server

Open new terminal and run the below commands.
```
sudo ffserver -f ./ffmpeg/server.conf
```

### Step 4 - Run the code

Open a new terminal to run the code.


### Setup the environment

You must configure the environment to use the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit one time per session by running the following command:
```
source /opt/intel/openvino/bin/setupvars.sh -pyver 3.5
```

You should also be able to run the application with Python 3.6, although newer versions of Python will not work with the app.

### Running on the CPU

When running Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit Python applications on the CPU, the CPU extension library is required. This can be found at: 

```
/opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/inference_engine/lib/intel64/
```

* Depending on whether you are using Linux or Mac, the filename will be either `libcpu_extension_sse4.so` or `libcpu_extension.dylib`, respectively.* (The Linux filename may be different if you are using a AVX architecture)

Though by default application runs on CPU, this can also be explicitly specified by ```-d CPU``` command-line argument:

```
python3 main.py -i resources/Pedestrian_Detect_2_1_1.mp4 -m ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_03_29/frozen_inference_graph.xml -l /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/inference_engine/lib/intel64/libcpu_extension_sse4.so -d CPU -pt 0.6 | ffmpeg -v warning -f rawvideo -pixel_format bgr24 -video_size 768x432 -framerate 24 -i - http://0.0.0.0:3004/fac.ffm
```
If you are in the classroom workspace, use the “Open App” button to view the output. If working locally, to see the output on a web based interface, open the link [http://0.0.0.0:3004] (http://0.0.0.0:3004/) in a browser.


### Running on the GPU

To use GPU in 16 bit mode, use the following command
```
python3 main.py -i resources/Pedestrian_Detect_2_1_1.mp4 -m ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_03_29/frozen_inference_graph.xml -l /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/inference_engine/lib/intel64/libcpu_extension_sse4.so -d GPU -pt 0.6 | ffmpeg -v warning -f rawvideo -pixel_format bgr24 -video_size 768x432 -framerate 24 -i - http://0.0.0.0:3004/fac.ffm
```
To see the output on a web based interface, open the link [http://0.0.0.0:3004](http://0.0.0.0:3004/) in a browser.


Note: The Intel® Neural Compute Stick can only run FP16 models. The model that is passed to the application, through the -m <path_to_model> command-line argument, must be of data type FP16.


To use GPU in 32 bit mode, use the following command
```
python3 main.py -i resources/Pedestrian_Detect_2_1_1.mp4 -m ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_03_29/frozen_inference_graph.xml -l /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/inference_engine/lib/intel64/libcpu_extension_sse4.so -d GPU -pt 0.6 | ffmpeg -v warning -f rawvideo -pixel_format bgr24 -video_size 768x432 -framerate 24 -i - http://0.0.0.0:3004/fac.ffm
To see the output on a web based interface, open the link [http://0.0.0.0:3004](http://0.0.0.0:3004/) in a browser.
```


### Running on the Intel® Neural Compute Stick

To run on the Intel® Neural Compute Stick, use the ```-d MYRIAD``` command-line argument:

```
python3.5 main.py -d MYRIAD -i resources/Pedestrian_Detect_2_1_1.mp4 -m ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_03_29/frozen_inference_graph.xml /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/inference_engine/lib/intel64/libcpu_extension_sse4.so -d GPU -pt 0.6 | ffmpeg -v warning -f rawvideo -pixel_format bgr24 -video_size 768x432 -framerate 24 -i - http://0.0.0.0:3004/fac.ffm
```

To see the output on a web based interface, open the link [http://0.0.0.0:3004](http://0.0.0.0:3004/) in a browser.

**Note:** The Intel® Neural Compute Stick can only run FP16 models at this time. The model that is passed to the application, through the `-m <path_to_model>` command-line argument, must be of data type FP16.


### Running on the FPGA

Before running the application on the FPGA, program the AOCX (bitstream) file. Use the setup_env.sh script from fpga_support_files.tgz to set the environment variables.

source /home/<user>/Downloads/fpga_support_files/setup_env.sh
The bitstreams for HDDL-F can be found under the /opt/intel/openvino/bitstreams/a10_vision_design_bitstreams folder. To program the bitstreams use the below command.

aocl program acl0 /opt/intel/openvino/bitstreams/a10_vision_design_bitstreams/2019R1_PL1_FP11_RMNet.aocx
For more information on programming the bitstreams, please refer to https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/OpenVINO-Install-Linux-FPGA#inpage-nav-11

To run the application on the FPGA with floating point precision 16 (FP16), use the -d HETERO:FPGA,CPU command-line argument:
    
```   
python3.5 main.py -d HETERO:FPGA,CPU -i resources/Pedestrain_Detect_2_1_1.mp4 -l /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/inference_engine/lib/intel64/libcpu_extension_sse4.so -m ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_03_29/frozen_inference_graph.xml -pt 0.6 | ffmpeg -v warning -f rawvideo -pixel_format bgr24 -video_size 768x432 -framerate 24 -i - http://localhost:8090/fac.ffm    
```
      
### Using a camera stream instead of a video file

To get the input video from the camera, use the `-i CAM` command-line argument. Specify the resolution of the camera using the `-video_size` command line argument.

For example:
```
python main.py -i CAM -m ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_03_29/frozen_inference_graph.xml -l /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/inference_engine/lib/intel64/libcpu_extension_sse4.so -d CPU -pt 0.6 | ffmpeg -v warning -f rawvideo -pixel_format bgr24 -video_size 768x432 -framerate 24 -i - http://0.0.0.0:3004/fac.ffm
```

To see the output on a web based interface, open the link [http://0.0.0.0:3004](http://0.0.0.0:3004/) in a browser.

**Note:**
User has to give `-video_size` command line argument according to the input as it is used to specify the resolution of the video or image file.

### A Note on Running Locally

The servers herein are configured to utilize the Udacity classroom workspace. As such,
to run on your local machine, you will need to change the below file:

```
webservice/ui/src/constants/constants.js
```

The `CAMERA_FEED_SERVER` and `MQTT_SERVER` both use the workspace configuration. 
You can change each of these as follows:

```
CAMERA_FEED_SERVER: "http://localhost:3004"
...
MQTT_SERVER: "ws://localhost:3002"
```
